# HYPNOS

Hypnos is a tool to better handle errors for GraphQL calls to RESTful API’s using Apollo Client’s Apollo-link-rest package. User can put in an endpoint for a RESTful API and mock up an Apollo-link-rest call and will receive either meaningful errors or their expected data. 

Hypnos is currently in beta.

*\* We recently added tabs to handle multiple entries!* 

# GETTING STARTED

Download for Mac, Windows, or Linux [will have links]

Install the app to your applications folder. Hypnos runs on localhost:3000

# HOW TO USE

### Enter in your API endpoint

Hypnos supports calls to open APIs and APIs requiring a key. Future versions will include support for APIs requiring Basic Auth and Oauth2



### Enter your Apollo-link-rest query

A sample query is provided. Further documentation on Apollo-link-rest calls can be found in the Apollo GraphQL documents site here: <https://www.apollographql.com/docs/link/links/rest/>


### Hypnos will provide meaningful errors



### Hypnos history

Hypnos will also locally keep track of your call history. Your history can be deleted and individual entries will be editable and added to the history when used. 

### Tabs

Test multiple calls at once by opening new tabs
